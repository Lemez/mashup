	"explanation" :	"A subordinate clause cannot stand on its own in a sentence but it adds meaning to the sentence’s main clause. Consider the following sentence:\nShe watched her friend as she walked down the road.\nIn this sentence, ‘as she walked down the road’ is a subordinate clause. A subordinate clause starts with a subordinating conjunction in this case being 'as'.\n\nWhen two clauses that can both appear on their own (independent clauses) are conjoined into one sentence, they are connected with a coordinating conjunction:\nI like apples but Jane likes pears.\nHere, ‘but’ is the coordinating conjunction and the two clauses that it connect could both be a sentence of their own.",
