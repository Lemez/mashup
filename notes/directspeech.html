Look at these this sentence:</br></br><em>The dog said,"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm bored of bones and I want some cake!"</span></em></br></br>The underlined part is called <b>direct speech</b>, and we use inverted commas or speech marks (") to make it. With direct speech, we can show  what somebody said exactly - every word. Notice the comma that comes just before the direct speech.</br></br> Here's another sentence: </br></br><em>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excuse me,"</span> said the squirrel to the shopkeeper, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">can you show me where the nuts are?"</span></em></br></br>When you break direct speech up into two parts, you need to put a comma after the first part as well.
