Commas make a sentence easy to understand.  We can use them in a few different ways:</br><ul><li>to make a list (except at the end of the list, where we put 'and'):</br><em>My pet goldfish likes ballet, football, puddles and being silly.</em></li></br><li>before direct speech (which is when someone says something):</br><em>The whale said, "Can I eat your sandwich?"</em></br></li></br><li>After an adverb clause, which introduces a sentence like this:</br><em>Before you talk to a hedgehog, make sure your hands are clean.</em></li></br><li> Around a subordinate clause (which adds something interesting) in the middle of a sentence:</br><em>The hamster, who was very tired, fell asleep on her pyjamas.</em></li></ul>
