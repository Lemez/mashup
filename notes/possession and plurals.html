Look at these this sentence:</br></br><em>Here are Tom<span style="text-decoration: underline;">'s</span> friend<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>.</em></br></br>The letter S comes twice. When you put an S together with an apostrophe, like this - 'S - it shows us whose friends they are. The S in <em>Tom<span style="text-decoration: underline;">'s</em></span> is called a <b>possessive S</b>, because it tells you who the friends belong to. </br></br>The second S does a different job. The S in <em>friend<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></em> tells us there is more than one friend. </br> Adding an S at the end of a noun like <em>friend</em> changes it from a singular word into a <b>plural</b> word: <em>friend<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></em>.  </br></br>
