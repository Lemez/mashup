Look at this sentence:</br></br><em>The cat, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">who had just got up"</span>, brushed her teeth with a fishbone.</em></br></br>The underlined part is called a <b>relative clause</b> - it's something in the middle of a sentence that adds more meaning.</br></br>A <b>relative clause</b> always starts with a <b>relative pronoun</b> - a word like <em>that</em>, <em>who</em>, <em>where</em> and <em>which</em> - that relates to the word before. Here we need a comma to start it, and a comma to finish with.</br></br><em>The tortoise <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that comes here on Tuesdays</span> is wearing glasses.</em></br></br>In this sentence, the relative clause is so important that we don't have to put any commas around it. The rule is: if you take out the relative clause and you don't know who we are talking about, you can leave the commas out.
